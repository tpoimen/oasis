# Oasis
Oasis is a personal project centered around operating system development for the x86 architecture.

It is intended to help further develop my low level programming skills as well as my knowledge of how operating systems work.

## (Very Distant) Long-term Goals
1. Networking capabilities (communicate with Oasis without a wired connection)
2. Multitasking on a single core (context switching, multithreading, etc.)
3. Port a large preexisting application over to Oasis (e.g. Doom)

## Key Resources That Helped With Developing Oasis
1. [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org)
2. [WYOOS Repo + Youtube Vidoes](https://github.com/AlgorithMan-de/wyoos)
